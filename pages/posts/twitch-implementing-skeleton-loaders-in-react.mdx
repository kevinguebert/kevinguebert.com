# [Twitch] Implementing Skeleton Loaders ðŸ’€ in React

Skeleton loaders have always been a beautiful way to showcase to a user that 'something is happening'. Turns out it isn't as hard to implement as I thought! I was able to utilize a simple `npm` library to help us out in this endeavour. From there, thanks to our `useSWR` hooks, we were able to quickly implement our `loading` states based off of the status of our requests. Easy peasy!
