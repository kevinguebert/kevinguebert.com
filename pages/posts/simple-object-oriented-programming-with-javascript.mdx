# Simple Object Oriented Programming with Javascript

## Constructing

With the introduction of ES6, creating classes in Javascript has improved. Even though the new syntax boils down to the same as it was previously done, coming from other OOP languages makes it easier to understand.

Previously, for creating classes before ES6 we would do it this way:

```js
function Pet(type, name) {
  this.type = type;
  this.name = name;
}
var winnie = new Pet("cat", "Winnie");
```

Now with ES6, we can use the class syntax:

```js
class Pet {
  constructor(type, name) {
    this.type = type;
    this.name = name;
  }
}
var toby = new Pet("dog", "Toby");
```

If you want to check and see whether these are the same, you can run a typeof on both of them and you will see that both are of type function!

## Inheritance

Inheritance with Javascript works very similarly to other languages:

```js
class Pet {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  feed() {
    console.log(`Feeding ${this.name}`);
  }
}

class Cat extends Pet {
  constructor(name) {
    super(name);
    console.log("Cat created");
  }
  meow() {
    console.log("Meow!");
  }
}

class Dog extends Pet {
  constructor(name) {
    super(name);
    console.log("Dog Created");
  }
  bark() {
    console.log("Woof!");
  }
}

const winnie = new Cat("Winnie"); // Cat created
const toby = new Dog("Toby"); // Dog created
winnie.name; // "Winnie"
toby.name; // "Toby"
winnie.meow(); // "Meow!"
winnie.bark(); // Uncaught TypeError: winnie.bark is not a function
toby.bark(); // "Woof!"
toby.meow(); // Uncaught TypeError: toby.meow is not a function
winnie.feed(); // Feeding Winnie
toby.feed(); // Feeding Toby
```

As you can see above, both Cat and Dog inherit the same feed() method, but they both have their own methods meow() and bark() that only those instances can reference!

Hope you enjoy this little JS snippet!
