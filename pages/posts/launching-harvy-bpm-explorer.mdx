# Launching Harvy BPM Explorer

slug: "launching-harvy-bpm-explorer"
My first launch of a product within the Harvy family, I'm happy to share the BPM Explorer. This website has one simple goal - return the BPM of whatever song you are searching for. From there you can go ahead and play the song of Spotify to jam out to.

‚ÄçBPM Explorer is a simple React app built with Firebase and Spotify's API.
