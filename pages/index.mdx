# Kevin Guebert

Hey, I'm a Developer Advocate and Team Lead at [NCR](https://developer.ncr.com/). I enjoy working on web and iOS experiences, reading documentation, and growing my skills as a software engineer. 

Recently I've been researching how I can use my skills to help combat climate change. If you're interested, a good place to start would be to listen to the [How to Save a Planet](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/howtosaveaplanet) podcast or watch [David Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet](https://www.netflix.com/title/80216393). Also check out [ClimateAction.tech](https://climateaction.tech/) and [Work on Climate](https://workonclimate.org/) for larger communities.

My online usage goes in waves but more recently I've learned that [being](https://www.wired.com/story/stop-doomscrolling/) [online](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/coronavirus-doom-scrolling-stop/2020/07/29/2c87e9b2-d034-11ea-8d32-1ebf4e9d8e0d_story.html) [all the time](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/19/892728595/your-doomscrolling-breeds-anxiety-here-s-how-to-stop-the-cycle) [has a](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/all-publications/the-impact-of-climate-change-on-mental-health-and-emotional-wellbeing-current-evidence-and-implications-for-policy-and-practice.php) [negative](https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-a-warming-planet/how-to-combat-climate-depression) [impact](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/climate-change-mental-health#block-755f8908-6ce0-465f-a7ff-34aaa355fd23) [on](https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2017/03/13/519977607/irresistible-by-design-its-no-accident-you-cant-stop-looking-at-the-screen) [my mental](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/style/self-care/social-media-.html) [health](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/07/how-twitter-fuels-anxiety/534021/). I enjoy mowing the lawn more than I do scrolling through Twitter. If you need me, feel free to [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/kevinguebert) or drop me an email, I would be happy to chat.
