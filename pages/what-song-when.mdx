# What Song When

_Work in Progress_

What Song When (WSW) is my most recent adventure in a side project. Currently in active development, WSW utilizes the Spotify API (again) with a unique voting system to find the perfect song for any moment.

You can visit WSW at [https://whatsongwhen.com](https://whatsongwhen.com) to signup and get notified of updates. Lastly, I log all my tasks on [Makerlog](https://getmakerlog.com/@kevin).
