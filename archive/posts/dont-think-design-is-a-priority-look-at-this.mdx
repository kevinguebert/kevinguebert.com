# Don't think design is a priority? Look at this.

Let me preface this by saying I am not a designer, I am a developer at heart. My "design process" is usually taking Bootstrap or Foundation and applying it to my latest project to get a pretty basic design. This process more or less gets the job done but never has anything that makes you say "wow." For my latest project [**Harvy**](https://harvy.app/), I decided I wanted to take it further than I had with any other project. What this meant was I was spending more time doing research, development, and marketing...but I still kept my generic Bootstrap theme.

If you had checked out [**Harvy **](https://harvy.app/)_one day ago_, this is what you would have seen:

Now that isn't a _terrible_ design. There's some hierarchy(ish), a couple images, some icons, a consistent tone (neutral colors), and a basic call out area. Pretty darn basic though - it is a Bootstrap-designed website and it looks like it.

I knew that wasn't good enough though. I knew it could be better and in my heart it didn't feel like a finished product with that design. Now if you've been around IndieHackers for a bit you probably have heard of [**ManyPixels**](https://www.indiehackers.com/product/manypixels), a designer service where you pay a monthly fee for designs. I was originally looking at 99designs and Upwork but decided to try out ManyPixels due to the IndieHackers creating it and the price.

Let me tell you, it's worth it. If you are at all on the fence about design and can afford a month of ManyPixels, do it. Why? Check out version 2.0 of [**Harvy**](https://harvy.app/):

Now **that's a design**. I cannot applaud the ManyPixels team enough and I could not recommend them enough. My confidence in launching [**Harvy**](https://harvy.app/) has definitely improved and I am excited about what the future holds. [**Check out the whole homepage**](https://harvy.app/) and you can see all that they did to help me out - all under 2 weeks (including logo, illustrations, and homepage redesign). [**ManyPixels even does a referral program**](https://manypixels.co/referral/m0hfdkk) (not the original intent of this article) that can get you [**20% off your subscription**](https://manypixels.co/referral/m0hfdkk). **Design is important**. **Design should be a priority**.

Don't be like me and think you can "fake it till you make it" when it comes to design. Use a landing page builder, use ManyPixels, use 99Designs, use something! (Unless you are a designer, then you already have the skills!)If you want to see all the original designs compared to now, [**send me a message**](https://twitter.com/kevinguebert) and I can share them with you.

Unfortunately I can't put the two side by side here. I'll tell you this though, it's a big change.

[**Be sure to visit Harvy & let me know if you have any feedback on this new design!**](https://harvy.app/)
