# Understanding Logical Operators with Non-boolean Objects in Javascript

Usually with logical operators in Javascript, one would use boolean checks. For example:

```js
if (true) {
  // do this
} else {
  // do that
}
```

With these operations, we can easily condense the above code:

```js
var x = 1;
var result = x > 0 ? "x is greater than 0" : "x is not greater than 0";
```

The above situations are fairly straight forward because we have a defined and known value that evalues to true or false. What happens though when you introduce values that could be truthy or fasly?

The same logic applies, one needs to be more careful though with the output. Remember, that many variables may be considered truthy depending on their type. Objects _always evaluate to truthy even if they are empty_.

```js
var sO = {};
const opt = sO || { name: "Default" };
const opt2 = !sO || { name: "Default" };
const opt3 = !!sO || { name: "Default" };

opt = {};
// opt2 = {name: 'Default'}
// opt3 = true
```

So be careful if you are every checking against non-boolean objects! Make sure you know what the expected boolean output of that object is, it may not be what you think logically.

Here's a couple examples of things that come out to be truthy:

- Any object (even if it is empty)
- Any array (even if it is empty)
- Strings containing only whitespace (" ")
- The string "false"

Some falsy objects:

- undefined
- null
- false
- 0
- NaN
- '' (empty string)
