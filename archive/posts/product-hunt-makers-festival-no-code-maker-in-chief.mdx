# Product Hunt Maker's Festival No-Code Maker in Chief!

_A few weeks late..._

The Product Hunt Maker's Festival 2019 No-Code edition was a blast to work on a a great challenge to all makers.

I'm psyched to [**share that I was chosen as "Maker in Chief"!**](https://www.producthunt.com/newsletter/2700)[**Emoodji**](https://coda.io/d/Emoodji_d2tRkelpm2c/History_suC_k?viewMode=play#_luQOO) was chosen as the grand prize winner - a no-code tool I built using Coda.io to track your mood.

What makes [**Emoodji special?**](https://coda.io/d/Emoodji_d2tRkelpm2c/History_suC_k?viewMode=play#_luQOO) Emoodji is based on the PANAS Scale:

_The PANAS Scale or Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) is a self-report questionnaire. The list is split up into two segments, or mood scales. One scale measures a person‚Äôs positive emotion and the other scale measures the negative. Each segment has ten terms, which can be rated on a scale of 1 to 5 to indicate the extent to which the respondent agrees that this applies to him. The PANAS Scale was developed in 1988 by three American psychologists: David Watson, Lee Anna Clark and Auke Tellegen_

And the Maker-in-Chief is none other than [**@kevinguebert**](https://twitter.com/kevinguebert?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw), who created Emoodji, a personal mood tracker complete with randomized GIFs, automated reminders, and mobile-friendly buttons. Congratulations! üëè[**https://t.co/Gvnu4b6Oer**](https://t.co/Gvnu4b6Oer)[**pic.twitter.com/rIrEnV5aYl**](https://t.co/rIrEnV5aYl) ‚Äî Coda (@coda*hq) [April 9, 2019](*[**_https://twitter.com/coda_**](https://twitter.com/coda)hq/status/1115683821871980544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)
